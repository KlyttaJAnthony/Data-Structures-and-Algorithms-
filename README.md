# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-
This is a repository for my learning of Data Structures and Algorithms. I am reading Data Structures and Algorithms by Robert LaFore to achieve this. Moreover, this repository also contains some projects that pertain to these data structures and algorithms. Some are silly, and some are useful. 

Under the Data Structures and Algorithms folder, you will find multiple folders that contain particular exercises as well as a projects and c++ folder that I am both learning and building. 
I will continue to update the repository with separate folders, but for the moment the DataStructuresAndAlgs folder contains all files pertaining to the subject.
